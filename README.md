# WebScrapping-Challenge

Tis repository analyzes the relationship between the number of terrestrial (Earth) days and the minimum temperature on Mars. It includes Python code to plot this relationship using Matplotlib.

## Introduction
Understanding the temperature patterns on Mars over time is crucial for various scientific investigations, such as studying Martian climate dynamics and planning future missions to Mars. This project aims to visualize the relationship between the number of terrestrial days and the minimum temperature on Mars using Python programming language and Matplotlib library.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine.
